# üîë Privy Integration in Hadi AI

## Overview
[Privy](https://privy.io/) simplifies **Web3 onboarding** with **embedded wallets & policy-based transaction controls**.

## üöÄ How Hadi AI Uses Privy
‚úÖ **Provides seamless onboarding for Web3 & non-Web3 users.**  
‚úÖ **Implements server wallets for AI-driven DeFi investments.**  
‚úÖ **Uses Privy‚Äôs Policy Engine to allowlist tokens.**  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

Keywords: Policy, Allowlist

// TODO: add explanation of all available functions to call and how to call them policies

We created an eliza plugin-privy for creating server wallets with policies.

For this project we created a policy called Hadi with the ID: zh4ugr13u3maafdrmrvvrt40

The agent has an allowlist of token that are sharia confirm. This list can be updated by calling the plugin to say:

Get all tokens allowlisted
```
Hi Hadi,
Which tokens are Halal?
```


Update allowlisted tokens (add or remove)
```
Hi Hadi,
Please add this BNB token with the address 0xB8c77482e45F1F44dE1745F52C74426C631bDD52 to the allowlist.
```


Our Agent would create all server wallet with this policy as default. 

- currently the only Policies that can be created through this plugin are allowlisting of token addresses. 

The following questions can be asked:

- Is this token halal?
- Is this token Sharia confirm?


the following action can be taken
- Add this token to the list of Sharia compliant tokens





The halalScannerToken could call the pluginPrivy to update the policy to add a token to the allowlist. 




## Docs Feedback

- Example on the [Create Policy page](https://docs.privy.io/guide/server-wallets/policies/create#example) adn update policy has to many commas and is throwing an Invalid JSON error
- The issues were:
    Missing comma after "name": "Allowlist USDC"
    Extra comma after the conditions object
    Extra comma after the method_rules array
    Remember in JSON:
    You need commas between items in arrays and objects
    You should not have a comma after the last item in an array or object
- Example on the Update Policy page is throwing an error:
  - The changes:
    Removed the default_action field since it's not allowed in the PATCH request
    Only included the method_rules which is what we want to update
    Remember:
    default_action can only be set during policy creation (POST request)
    PATCH requests should only include the fields you want to update
- When I google for policy engine, the first result in the google search leads to a 404: https://docs.privy.io/guide/wallet-api/policies
