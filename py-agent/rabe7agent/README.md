<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project


Hadi is a multi-agent system, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com), designed to analyze, validate, and execute Shariah-compliant and ethical investments in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Our system leverages autonomous AI agents to research, assess risk, ensure compliance, and develop investment strategies tailored to ethical finance principles.

Hadi aims to bridge the gap between DeFi innovation and responsible investing, allowing users to confidently participate in Halal and ethical financial opportunities while ensuring security, compliance, and profitability.




<!-- Problems -->
## :bomb: Problems
The decentralized finance space is growing rapidly, but ethical investment barriers still exist:

1️⃣ Lack of Shariah-Compliant DeFi Solutions

Many DeFi platforms engage in interest-based (riba) and speculative (maysir) practices, making them non-compliant with Islamic finance principles.
2️⃣ Complexity & Lack of Transparency in DeFi

Investors struggle to assess protocol risks, governance structures, and compliance due to the lack of structured verification systems.
3️⃣ High Volatility and Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

DeFi protocols often experience security exploits, market instability, and liquidity risks, leading to unexpected losses.
4️⃣ Limited Awareness of ESG and Ethical Investment Opportunities

Ethical investors find it challenging to discover and validate sustainable DeFi projects aligned with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) values.
5️⃣ Manual Research & Inefficient Investment Strategies

Investors spend significant time analyzing DeFi protocols without AI-powered insights, making decision-making slow and inefficient.

Integrating Aleph Zero and ink! into PLEARN can offer unique character ownership through NFTs, enabling character-specific benefits within the game. Furthermore, by connecting to Aleph Zero's DeFi ecosystem, we can create innovative financial applications within the game, allowing players to explore financial management, investments, and other DeFi functionalities through their in-game characters and assets. This integration can enhance user experiences and financial literacy.

4- ASTAR

Participating in the ASTAR bounty is an excellent opportunity to strengthen the character part of your game and leverage the blockchain's capabilities to provide secure and verifiable character ownership, transactions, and marketplace interactions. This aligns with PLEARN's concept of combining financial education with an immersive gaming experience.

## How to Integrate:

Ink! Smart Contracts for NFT Characters: Develop ink! smart contracts that represent the in-game characters as NFTs. This establishes a blockchain-backed ownership system.

User-Friendly Interface: Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing characters. Ensure that players can easily view, trade, or customize their NFT characters.

#### Game’s setting:
 Soloplayer setting on one board
   

#### End-game goals Knowledge:
The end-game goals of PLEARN, in terms of knowledge, are to equip players with comprehensive financial literacy and empower them with practical skills for managing their finances effectively. These goals include:

- Investment Literacy: Players should gain a deep understanding of various investment opportunities, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, and real estate. They should be able to evaluate investment options, assess risks, and make informed decisions to grow their wealth.

- Financial Decision-Making: PLEARN aims to enhance players' abilities to make sound financial decisions. This includes budgeting, saving, and making choices about spending, all based on a solid financial understanding.

- Risk Management: Understanding financial risk is essential. Players should be able to assess and mitigate financial risks associated with investments and be prepared for unexpected financial challenges.

- Asset Management: By the end of the game, players should be proficient in managing their assets, which may include optimizing investment portfolios, property management, and wealth diversification.

- Long-Term Financial Planning: PLEARN encourages players to consider their long-term financial goals, such as retirement planning, and how to create a sustainable financial future.

- Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Knowledge: For players to fully grasp the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in today's financial landscape.
  

#### Game Components
The game components of PLEARN include various elements that contribute to the gaming experience and the learning of financial literacy. These components are designed to engage players and provide opportunities to gain practical knowledge about finance, investments, and asset management. Here are the key game components:

- Game Board: A virtual game board that serves as the central gameplay area, where players navigate through financial scenarios and investment opportunities.

- Game Tokens: Virtual tokens representing players on the game board. These tokens are moved to different spaces as players progress through the game.

- Assets: These represent the financial resources available to players. Assets can include virtual currency, stocks, cryptocurrencies, and real estate properties.

- Market Spaces: Spaces on the game board that simulate real-life financial markets, such as stock exchanges and cryptocurrency markets. Players can buy and trade assets here.

- Event Cards: These cards introduce random financial events and challenges that players must navigate. Events can include market fluctuations, investment opportunities, and unexpected expenses.

- Mission Cards: Missions are financial challenges and tasks that players must complete to gain rewards and advance in the game. These missions relate to different aspects of financial literacy.

- Player Profiles: Each player has a virtual profile that tracks their progress, investments, and financial decisions throughout the game.

- Blockchain Integration: This unique component allows players to experience real ownership of in-game assets by leveraging blockchain technology. It provides transparency and security to in-game transactions.

- Educational Content: Alongside the game, educational content is provided to players. This can include explanations, tutorials, and real-world financial tips to enhance financial literacy.

- Leaderboards: A feature to track player performance and achievements. It encourages competition and motivation to improve financial knowledge.
    

#### Game Setup:
1. Wallet Connection: Users can integrate their MetaMask Wallet seamlessly into the platform. This wallet connection will be essential for managing in-game assets and transactions.

3. In-Game Currency: PLEARN primarily operates with USDT (Tether) as the in-game currency. If users do not possess USDT, they can convert their fiat currency into USDT within the platform. Alternatively, users can deposit their existing USDT to initiate their financial adventures.

4. Avatars as NFTs: User profiles, represented as avatars, are unique NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Players have the flexibility to incorporate their pre-owned NFTs into the game. Additionally, they can mint brand-new avatars directly within the platform. This NFT integration adds a personalized touch to the gaming experience.

5. Transaction Fees: For every financial move within the game, players will encounter transaction fees. The specific percentage for these fees is under consideration, ensuring a balance between fair gaming and platform sustainability.

#### Game Phases:
Phase 1 PvE (Players vs Environment): in this phase players will be playing against the environment, so, there will be no interaction with other players. Phase 2: PvP (Player vs Player): players will interact with each other. This mode will be unlocked after the player finishes PvE mode. Once players arrive in this phase, they will be able to buy & sell between each other.
