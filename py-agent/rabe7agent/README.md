<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project


Hadi is a multi-agent system, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com), designed to analyze, validate, and execute Shariah-compliant and ethical investments in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Our system leverages autonomous AI agents to research, assess risk, ensure compliance, and develop investment strategies tailored to ethical finance principles.

Hadi aims to bridge the gap between DeFi innovation and responsible investing, allowing users to confidently participate in Halal and ethical financial opportunities while ensuring security, compliance, and profitability.




<!-- Problems -->
## :bomb: Problems
The decentralized finance space is growing rapidly, but ethical investment barriers still exist:

1️⃣ Lack of Shariah-Compliant DeFi Solutions
Many DeFi platforms engage in interest-based (riba) and speculative (maysir) practices, making them non-compliant with Islamic finance principles.

2️⃣ Complexity & Lack of Transparency in DeFi
Investors struggle to assess protocol risks, governance structures, and compliance due to the lack of structured verification systems.

3️⃣ Limited Awareness of ESG and Ethical Investment Opportunities
Ethical investors find it challenging to discover and validate sustainable DeFi projects aligned with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) values.


4️⃣ Manual Research & Inefficient Investment Strategies
Investors spend significant time analyzing DeFi protocols without AI-powered insights, making decision-making slow and inefficient.

The decentralized finance space is growing rapidly, but ethical investment barriers still exist:

1️⃣ Lack of Shariah-Compliant DeFi Solutions
Many DeFi platforms engage in interest-based (riba) and speculative (maysir) practices, making them non-compliant with Islamic finance principles.


2️⃣ Complexity & Lack of Transparency in DeFi
Investors struggle to assess protocol risks, governance structures, and compliance due to the lack of structured verification systems.


3️⃣ High Volatility and Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
DeFi protocols often experience security exploits, market instability, and liquidity risks, leading to unexpected losses.


4️⃣ Limited Awareness of ESG and Ethical Investment Opportunities
Ethical investors find it challenging to discover and validate sustainable DeFi projects aligned with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) values.


5️⃣ Manual Research & Inefficient Investment Strategies
Investors spend significant time analyzing DeFi protocols without AI-powered insights, making decision-making slow and inefficient.


## How Hadi Works
Hadi introduces an agent-based system that automates the entire ethical investment process using CrewAI and blockchain plugins:

🔹 Communication Agent → Collects investment goals from users.

🔹 Manager Agent → Assigns tasks to other agents and manages execution.

🔹 Research Agent → Gathers real-time data on DeFi projects.

🔹 Validation Agent → Verifies if the projects comply with Shariah finance and ESG standards.

🔹 Trading Strategy Agent → Builds a profitable and ethical investment strategy.

🔹 Risk Advisor Agent → Assesses financial risks, smart contract vulnerabilities, and market conditions.

🔹 Reporting Agent → Compiles findings into a detailed investment report for user approval.

pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

(Optional) Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command:
```bash
crewai install
```
### Customizing

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**

- Modify `src/rabe7agent/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
- Modify `src/rabe7agent/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks
- Modify `src/rabe7agent/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools and specific args
- Modify `src/rabe7agent/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks


## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
$ crewai run
```

This command initializes the rabe7Agent Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.

This example, unmodified, will run the create a `report.md` file with the output of a research on LLMs in the root folder.

## Understanding Your Crew

The rabe7Agent Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.
